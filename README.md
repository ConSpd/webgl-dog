# WebGL Dog
This project walks through the creation of a 3D Dog with animation capabilities using Javascript's **WebGL** API.

### First Stage
Initialization of shaders and and creation of the structure block using 2 triangles for each square. Also applying temporary colors.
At this stage using the radio buttons we can view the block from every perspective and change the View Angle

### Third Stage
Added a spiral movement of the camera around the dog always looking at the center of the scene, user can manipulate the camera and movement using the mouse.
